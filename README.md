# jQuery Implementation Block

# Set up

 1. Create a new directory in your wyncode folder and name it jQueryImplementation.
 2. Move into the newly created folder.
 3. Clone the jQuery implementation repo from github
 4. In your command line run **npm install** or **yarn install**
 5. Start the **server.js** file by running **node server.js**

# Instructions

 1. Import jQuery into your app.
 2. Use jquery to select all buttons in your html page, and then add the **special-button** class to them.
 3. Add a **click** event listener to both theme **buttons** located on the top right corner of your html page.
 4. Pass a callback function to the event listeners you created in the previous step that changes the 
 **background-color** style property of the element with **id** of **content** to either red or blue.
 
 5. Add a **click** event listener to the **import people** button.
 6. Pass a callback function to the event listener you created in the previous step. This function should make a  **GET** request to the server you are running, and it should target the **/users** endpoint.
 7. Iterate over each element in the data array that you got from your request. 
 8. For each element create an **li** element that wraps around with the data of each element as its content, as well as a button.
 9. Give each **li** a **person-li** class.
 10. Append each one of these elements to the **ul**.
